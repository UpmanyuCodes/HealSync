## Project Description

HealSync is a front-end web application designed to address critical communication and coordination gaps in restorative healthcare. Inspired by the challenges faced by patients and providers at REUTH Hospital, Israel, this project aims to create a transparent, consistent, and empowering journey for patients in recovery.

## The Problem Solved

The current process in many restorative healthcare settings lacks clarity and coordination, leading to a disjointed patient experience. HealSync directly tackles key challenges:

* **Inconsistent Doctor Availability:** Patients face uncertainty and a lack of clear communication channels.
* **Lack of Clear Guidance:** Patients often do not receive timely guidance on their treatment plan.
* **Poor Communication:** There is no system to provide real-time updates on progress or next steps.
* **Missed Information:** Patients may miss critical instructions or doses, affecting treatment effectiveness.

HealSync is designed as a comprehensive solution to these problems, ensuring transparency and empowering patients throughout their recovery.
